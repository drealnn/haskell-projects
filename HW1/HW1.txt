Homework 1 
----------

THIS IS A DRAFT; I WILL DISCUSS THIS HOMEWORK (PROBLEM 2) IN
TODAY'S CLASS (01/26) BEFORE POSTING THE FINAL HOMEWORK AND
TEST CASES.

Problem 1:
----------

Implement the function 

  computePolygonArea :: [(Double,Double)] -> Double

that computes the area of the polygon.  The formula
for the area of the polygon is given at:

http://mathworld.wolfram.com/PolygonArea.html

You should implement the function

  det :: (Double,Double) -> (Double,Double) -> Double

that computes the determinate of the 2 x 2 matrix whose
columns are given by the first and second arguments, respectively.

You should use the det function in your computation of the
polygon area.

Problem 2:
----------

Read the subsections Setup and Movement of the section Rules 
at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess

Given the definitions

  type Position = (Char,Int)

  data Color =
    Black | White
    deriving (Eq,Show)

  data Piece =
    King | Queen | Rook | Bishop | Knight | Pawn
    deriving (Eq,Show)

implement the functions

  isValidPosition :: Position -> Bool
  -- valid row    indices are: a,b,c,...,h
  -- valid column indices are: 1,2,3,...,8

  isLegalMove :: Color -> Piece -> Position -> Position -> Bool
  -- the valid moves are explained at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess

that check whether a position is a valid board position and whether a
move by a piece is legal.
